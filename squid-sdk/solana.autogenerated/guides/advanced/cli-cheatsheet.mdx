# Squid CLI Cheatsheet

The [`sqd` CLI tool](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/tools/cli) has [built-in aliasing](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/tools/cli) that picks up custom commands defined in `commands.json` in the project root.

All [squid templates](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/evm/getting-started/squid-development#templates) include a pre-populated `commands.json` file with handy scripts for common development tasks.

## Getting Help

View all available commands (including custom commands from `commands.json`):

```bash
sqd --help
```

<Tip>
  Custom commands defined in `commands.json` will appear in the `SQUID COMMANDS`
  help section.
</Tip>

## Initial Setup

Before using the `sqd` CLI tool, install all project dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

## Building the Squid

Build your squid project:

```bash
sqd build
```

Delete all build artifacts:

```bash
sqd clean
```

## Running the Squid

<Note>
  The `sqd up` and `sqd down` commands assume that the `docker compose` command
  is supported and the Docker daemon is running. Modify the definitions in
  `commands.json` if `docker-compose` should be used instead.
</Note>

Start a local PostgreSQL database:

```bash
sqd up
```

Stop and remove the local PostgreSQL database:

```bash
sqd down
```

Run all services defined in `squid.yaml` locally:

```bash
sqd run [PATH]
```

Start the GraphQL server (development mode):

```bash
sqd serve
```

Start the GraphQL API server with caching and limits (production mode):

```bash
sqd serve:prod
```

## Database Migrations

For detailed information, see [TypeORM Migration generation](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/tools/migrations-gen).

Apply pending migrations:

```bash
sqd migration:apply
```

Generate a migration for the schema defined in `schema.graphql`:

```bash
sqd migration:generate
```

Clean the `db/migrations` folder:

```bash
sqd migration:clean
```

## Code Generation

For more details, see [TypeORM Model generation](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/tools/model-gen) and [Type-safe decoding](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/tools/typegen).

Generate TypeORM entities from `schema.graphql`:

```bash
sqd codegen
```

Generate data access classes for ABI files in the `./abi` folder:

```bash
sqd typegen
```

<Info>
  Depending on the template, `sqd typegen` is aliased to a different typegen
  tool specific to the chain type. Run `sqd typegen --help` for details.
