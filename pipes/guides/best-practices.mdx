### Where to keep state of stateful transforms

<Info>
The choice of state storage depends on your data volume, latency requirements, and computational resources.
</Info>

- **Keep state in RAM** if it can be cheaply reconstructed from limited historical data (example - 1-minute candles)

<Tip>
This approach offers the lowest latency.
</Tip>

- **Keep state in ClickHouse** and use materialized views if your transforms meet these criteria:

<Warning>
Do not form long dependency chains in latency-critical apps: each materialized view that depends on another materialized view increases the final latency.
</Warning>

<Note>
For very frequent changes on lightweight data, prefer plain (non-materialized) views. You must have computational resources to spare on the database machine to take this approach.
</Note>

- **If your destination requires pre-transformed data**, consider using stateful transformers:
  - [SQLite-based](https://github.com/subsquid-labs/pipes-sdk-docs/blob/feat/stateful-transform-on-sqlite/src/advanced/evm/09.stateful-transform-on-sqlite.example.ts) - for small applications
  - For large applications consider connecting your pipe to [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org)
