## Why Pipes SDK?

Pipes SDK was built to provide **extreme flexibility and extensibility** for blockchain data indexing. Unlike traditional indexing frameworks that lock you into specific databases or APIs, Pipes SDK lets you:

- **Integrate with existing systems**: Stream Solana blockchain data into your current infrastructure without restructuring your entire stack
- **Choose your own storage**: Use any database, data lake, or message queue as your target
- **Build custom pipelines**: Transform and route data exactly how you need it, with full control over every step
- **Work as a library**: Embed Pipes SDK into larger applications, microservices, or data processing workflows

Pipes SDK is designed for teams that need more control than a full-stack framework provides, but want more structure than raw RPC access.

## Architecture Flexibility

Pipes SDK's modular design means you can:

- **Mix and match components**: Use Portal sources with custom transformers and your own targets
- **Extend easily**: Create custom transformers for domain-specific logic
- **Scale independently**: Run multiple pipelines with different configurations
- **Deploy anywhere**: Works in Node.js, Docker, Kubernetes, or serverless environments

## Solana-Specific Features

Pipes SDK for Solana includes:

- **Instruction Decoding**: Decode program instructions using generated ABIs from IDLs
- **Discriminator Support**: Automatic handling of Anchor and native program discriminators (d1, d2, d4, d8)
- **Token Balance Tracking**: Track SPL token balance changes across transactions
- **Query Builder**: Filter by program ID, instruction discriminator, accounts, and more
- **RPC Latency Monitoring**: Built-in tools to monitor Solana RPC performance
