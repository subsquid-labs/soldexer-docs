Pipes SDK is a TypeScript library for retrieving blockchain data from SQD Portals and transforming it. It features:
 - **All features of the SQD Portal API:**
    * Data is downloaded in big chunks and at a high speed.
    * It is filtered on the server side - you only download what you need.
    * Real-time data is supported.
    * Information on blockchain reorganizations and finality is available; in standard modules these are handled automatically.
 - **Being a library**: although Pipes SDK can be used to build full-featured blockchain indexers, it is easy to embed it into larger applications, microservices, or data processing workflows.
 - **Reusable modules:** data filters can be bundled with transformation logic, and the resulting modules can be mixed and matched. For example you can create modules to get you data on Raydium swaps and SPL token balance updates, then just plug them into your pipe when you need either.
 - **Simplicity of extension:** we've made adding new modules as simple as possible.
    * This includes data sinks: adding support for your database, data lake or message queue is no longer a hassle.

## When to Use Pipes SDK

1. You want common protocols (SPL, Jupiter AMM, Raydium etc) handled for you. If all of your data is like that, you can start uploading it into your database in minutes.

2. You need deep customization of any part of the data pipeline.

## When to Use Alternatives

1. If you want to use Portal data in an non-JS app, consider using
   - [Raw Portal API](/api/catalog/stream) for all languages.
   - [sqd_py](https://pypi.org/project/sqd_py/) for Python.

2. Consider using [Squid SDK](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/evm.autogenerated) if:
   - You're making a self-contained Web3 data service such as a GraphQL API.
   - You're looking for an indexing framework similar to TheGraph, Ponder or Envio.
